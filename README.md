This project is a data analysis & classification demo on the performance of my helium hotspot miner(https://www.helium.com/) in relation to external factors such as capital markets, crypto markets, spokane weather data, and day of the week. In order to run the program simply run Utils2.py, then run all on Main.ipynb. My project is organized into 4 sections: introduction, data analysis, classification, and conclusion
